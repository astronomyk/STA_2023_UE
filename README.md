(Add thoughts here)

### Data sets
- How to find and use data sets
- How to process data sets using a variety of tools
- How to determine which (software) tool is the best for the job
- How to apply the theoretical concepts from the lectures to actual data sets
- What to do when two data sets don't match. Which set to choose as "reality".

### Programming and tools

- How to use Python, `numpy`, `astropy`, `matplotlib`
- How to use Jupyter notebooks
- Why and how to use GitHub
- Why not to use Excel

### Other skills

- Presenting results and work to audiences

## Grading

Projects can be submitted on paper, as a word doc, or as a jupyter notebook. Latex docs are also of course welcome.

The final report must be written similar to a scientific report with the following sections:

1. Summary of the scientific background
1. Statement of the problem
1. Description of the data sets used
1. Tasks for probability distributions
1. Tasks for Statistical inferences
1. Tasks for Hypothesis testing
1. Tasks for Linear regression
1. Discussion of meaning of the results
1. The use acceptable scientific writing standards (label and refer to figures, citations, etc)

Additional points will be awarded for:

1. Discussion of implicit assumption regarding the data set, and possible biases in the data (e.g. not accounting for extinction or redshift, etc)
1. Use of multiple data sets
1. Discussion of the differences between data sets, and the impact this has on the results
1. Uploading and storing data / notebooks / work on GitHub
